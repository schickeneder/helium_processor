# Helium Pre-Solana blockchain analysis tools

This is a collection of scripts used to parse and extract Proof-of-Coverage data as well as node locations and history from the Helium blockchain prior to its migration to Solana.
Please do not confuse this for "production ready" code.
Some of these use GPUs to accelerate processing, but in generaly they are not highly optimized for speed/efficiency and can take a while to run on the full blockchain dataset.
